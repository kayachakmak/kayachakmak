Hello! I'm Kaya, a former Chemical Engineer who has transitioned into the field of software development. My journey began with an intensive bootcamp, where I developed strong skills in front-end technologies such as JavaScript, React, and various React frameworks. Additionally, I gained experience with NoSQL databases.

Following the completion of the bootcamp, I have focused on expanding my knowledge in backend development, specifically learning Python. Thus, I have been working on some personal projects as a side hustle, currently developing a cyrptocurreny trading bot.

I'm super passionate about picking up new skills and staying in the loop with the latest tech trends. I love a good challenge and building cool stuff.
